-What data needed to be scraped from each account ?
PPV amount, PGPV,
the system need to be explain how it works but generally yes

1. Integrating Login with system.
2. Generating user friendly diagrams.
3. Creating Bonus calculating system.
4. Providing plan to the customer based on data.

My feedback
- Login System
Selenium Web drvier will be used for login and scraping. No better solution.
Captcha pass : There are some 3rd party services to provide APIs to solve captchas.
Since it's simple image captcha so I will develop a solution myself.

Download captcha image, Detect numbers with OpenCV and Tenserflow.

- Generating user friendly diagrams
* Scraping Data
No API.
Scrape data from the web page directly.

* Storing data and visualization.
Table are not enough since users are not technical savy.
Javascript libraries can be used to generate User friendly Diagram.
Javascript Char libraries, or D3.js.(Integration of D3 would take a bit more time.)
https://d3js.org/

My requirement : 
# Required fields with screenshot and description(pptx).
# How does the diagram looks like, or simple UI/UX sketch design if possible.
# How can they interact? Which data can be interacted with which formula and how etc..

- Creating Bonus calculating system.
- Providing plan to the customer based on data.
Can be discussed after Stage 1 and 2 completed.
